a matt x lila fanfic made by yours truly Frostic#0987

[Spooky School has just ended and now the Super Spooky Duo have gone on break! Skid had decided to ask his mother, Lila, if he can spend the spooky summer with pump and his family! Lila responds with:]
"Oh sure! I don't see why not, be careful you two"
[As skid marches out the door with pump, Lila has thoughts the speed of light what to do with her free time, Maybe make sure there are no more demonic boards in the house? or go on a miniature vacation away from architecture and keeping the kids safe as she deeply trusts pumps family]
[Suddenly the Tv plays an advertisement that catches her attention! the advertisement reads as:]
"Summer has just begun, isn't that a joy? I'm sure it is for both the children and the adults! luckily for you we've decided to releasing something absolutely groundbreaking in the realm of Fun for every member of the family, whether it's the parent, the creepy uncle, or even the kids!"
"introducing our new hip with the kids form of entertainment...."
"The Waluwii! (Nameselectedtoavoidcertainrestrictions) With this next generation immersive technology, not only will you feel like you're playing the game, it'll feel like you're living them too..."
"so make sure not to hog it too much, and let everyone experience their own enjoyment for this amazing, wonderful summer!"
"atyourlocalmarketmagicallyTODAY.    wearenotresponsibleforanylossesormissingpersonsreportsforthefollowingtwoyears"
[The television shows an oddly cheap rectangular and thin box, with a cartoon like bald character on the side, during the advertisement the commercial had played a couple pieces to gameplay, Lila had thought this might be a good escape instead]
[Utilizing the time she was given, she rushes to the local mart and purchases the new, smaller in person, technology. Her mind brainstorming what the actual possibilities may be, all with the excitement of plugging it in and having the rest of her time to herself]
[Lila walks through her front door, unplugs the VCR, and connects the new piece into the wall with great speed]
[Almost instantly, turns her television on... quite odd at first but she seems to ignore it]
[She's proposed a screen with one singular square in the middle.... called "Matt's Training"]
[Assuming it might be instructions for the piece of technology, Lila doesn't waste a second... but...]
[Suddenly without using any type of remote device, just looking at the square seemed to make her light headed.. dizzy...]
[While at the same time feeling entirely blissful and cozy, apparently falling asleep Lila slowly dozes off.....]
[Seemlessly Everything appears white with small small lighter gray squares.. she's floating? and somehow fully conscious and aware inside this odd dream like state..]
[The sound of static fills the space but slowly fades out.. in exchange fading in the sounds of a crowds roar, she feels.. excited, nervous even]
[she realizes she's not floating... She's falling! and at an alarming rate!! Lila starts realizing how close she is to this floor but..]
[In small distance she can make out one.. humanoid figure? with no arms.. odd... but to herself that doesn't take away the fact that she's about to hit the floor at a burning speed!]
[3..]
[2...]
[1.......]
[Start!]
[Lila slams into the circular type arena? landing on both feet without feeling anything but a rush inside her heart]
[Lila looks around frantically, Trying to piece together everything that had just happened]
[She collects herself quickly and breathes, calming down a bit]
[The sound of a very calm, but raspy and soothing voice pops from behind her]
"Training.. right?"
[Quickly turning around she's met with someone seemingly half their size, looking like both a child and an adult (midget? am I allowed to say that in this era)]
[Though his perfect face catches her off guard!]
(minus the gun please it's the only picture I had)
[A small blush comes from her face, but gone in an instant she attempts to say hello while waving her hand]
[All that comes out is some sort of... beep?]
[she also noticed that suddenly her arms are gone, and hands replaced with spherical orbs!]
(did you know that wii characters do not have arms?)
[Lila tries to talk again but... alas..] "ba"
[While having to blankly stare at the oddly handsome man now, Lila instead shakes her head]
[The man accepts this response and continues his speech]
"Wonderful! Though is a shame that yet another one cannot talk as I can.. (Did you know that wii characters do not have arms? [he utters under his breath with a small grin])"
[He still.. continues his speech]
[Matt huh? This name sounds very pleasant to Lila, She grins slightly.]
"Through experience I know you cannot introduce yourself so instead, why don't we get right into the training?"
[Lila nods excitedly "Finally, to the point" she thinks to herself]
[Matt exclaims:]
"Our first course of training will be singing, perfect for the voice you have conjured don't you think?"
[This catches Lila off guard too as she expected this to be a tutorial on how to use what she got bought, but she ended up agreeing and nodding anyways]
"Perfect, allow me to play my music to get us started" [says matt]
[matt pulls out a mixtape from... nowhere? named "light it up"]
[putting it into the boombox he had prepared, he says to Lila]
"My Training is a bit intense, they call me the king of this world due to my extreme measures, I hope you're ready.."
[Lila prepares for a battle like no other]
(Due to time cuts and absolutely no budget it will be skipped in it's entirety)
[The music fades out and the battle ends..]
[Lila, Exhausted from the fight collapses onto the ground]
[Matt rushes to Lila with a concerned look]
"Are you alright? maybe I've gone a bit too far for once.. you're burning up.. allow me to grab you some hydration"
[matt once again, pulling things from god knows where, takes out a water bottle and sits Lila up]
[Lila sees his concerned face.. and feels better knowing that maybe he's someone kinder than he had already seemed]
[Lila blacks out]
[Assuming she would wake up in the real world, she prepares to do so but is instead met with a blue sky]
[there is no more cheering crowd..]
[she sits up and looks around]
[remembering what had happened shes filled with even more excitement knowing where she still is]
[out of nowhere, matt yells for her, making her jump out of her skin at such a loud loud noise]
[Matt, seemingly joyful to see Lila awake and better smiles and gives her a hug, immediately pulling away and apologizing with an awkward blush..]
[Lila finds this cute and smiles.. She slowly stands up and speaks]
[forgetting that she can't talk, all that comes out is more boops and beeps]
[matt puts his.. hand? ball hand.. hand ball thing. infront of her mouth, shushing her]
[while also doing the same to himself he quietly signals her to follow him]
[still excited about the environment she gratefully agrees and starts following matt]
[they make their way off the arena and come to the top of this elevated hill]
[Time has passed since she blacked out and the sun is now about to set]
"This is the best seat in the house so far.. only I've ever been able to visit here.... but you.. you can interact.. you can understand everything entirely.." [says matt]
"I've never had that before..."
[matt turns Lilas head toward the opposite way of the sunset]
[the sky is becoming a grid, it give her a small chill..]
"Not everyone gets to stay past sunset..."
[says matt]
"They all leave me behind in this repeating world but... you're the only one who's properly.."
"or atleast half properly"
"spoken to me"
[Lila realizing the physical position she's in starts to gather a blush on her face, quickly pulling away from Matt with her breaths more rapid than before]
[instead of the blush fading like last time, it continues to grow stronger the more she's turned towards matt.. this is confusing her and making her feel weird.. she's forgotten where she is in this one moment]
[and only sees matt looking dreadfully towards the distance..]
[Matt turns towards Lila and rushes to a hug before suddenly everything goes black..]
[she can hear her heart beating and breaths as if they were the only sounds to exist..]
[She snaps back to consciousness and jumps up from her couch]
[with labored breaths, a dangerously fast beating heart, and sweat dripping down her face]
[she suddenly remembers everything and looks at the game system..]
[her face turns red for a moment before looking back at the screen..]
[The TV Is turned off While the prompt showing says..]
"You have Violated the Terms of MattsTraining.. Your system will from here be refunded and returned for Configuration, Please do not attempt to enter MattsTraining or buy another console from us again. Thank you!"
[Lila sits back down]
[Unsure if she feels upset, sad, devastated, or happy]
[She unplugs the system..]
[Suddenly a bright flash of light appears infront of her, For a brief moment seeing matt, hugging a grey model of a character on a hill..]
[The flash fades away and a note falls infront of her..]
"Thank you..."
[it reads]
"-Matt" [Appears on the back]
[Lilas chest grows deep for a moment.. before wiping it away and smiling instead, glad she had met matt..]
[or atleast..]
[Glad she could play the game..]
